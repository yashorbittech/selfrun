# Compliance and security: what is in place, what is not, and what only the owner can do

This folder is the working record of how SelfRunBusiness meets the requirements in *International Compliance and Security Requirements*
(target markets: United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, India, United States, Saudi Arabia). It is written to be checked: every statement points
at the code, page or procedure it rests on.

> **No system can guarantee 100% security, and a code review cannot make a company "compliant".** What this folder shows is the technical and
> documentary side, kept honest. Whether a law applies, a certification is worth pursuing, or a clause is acceptable is a decision for the owner
> and their legal adviser; those items are marked **Owner**.

## How to read the status words

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Done** | Built, working and verifiable in this repository |
| **Partial** | Built, but one part of the requirement still needs work, stated next to it |
| **Gap** | Not built; the remediation is listed |
| **Owner** | Needs a decision, a contract, a certificate or an action outside the code |

## What the owner must supply or decide (nothing in the code can do this)

1. The legal entity that operates the product (`SAAS_OPERATOR_NAME`), its registered address, and the governing law and courts for the Terms.
2. A named person for privacy (a Data Protection Officer where UK/EU/UAE rules require one, and the grievance officer India's DPDP Act requires), and the
   privacy mailbox (`SAAS_PRIVACY_EMAIL`, default `privacy@<domain>`) actually being read.
3. Counsel's review of every legal text above, in particular the DPA, the retention periods, and the cross-border transfer statements.
4. Signed data processing terms with each provider on the sub-processor list, and the regions the database and hosting run in.
5. An independent penetration test before launch and yearly, a decision on ISO/IEC 27001 and SOC 2, and a PCI DSS self-assessment (SAQ A) for the payment flow.
6. Platform settings: branch protection and required reviews on GitHub, a WAF/rate rules on the edge, a retained log destination, and the secrets listed in
   [gap-assessment.md](./gap-assessment.md).

Keep this folder current: when a control, a page or a provider changes, change the matching document in the same commit.
