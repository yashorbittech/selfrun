// Online Test System — recruitment screening tests for every job on the public careers page
// (`src/app/(site)/careers/jobs-data.ts`). Each role gets:
//   - a question category named after the role, with questions written from that job's listed skills;
//   - a published "<Role> Screening Test" (objective knowledge section + one written response marked by an evaluator),
//     held for the hiring team to publish (resultRelease "manual", score only);
//   - an assignment by POSITION to the real applicants who applied for that role (`career_applications.positionSlug`),
//     with attempts that match each applicant's hiring stage (shortlisted → not started yet, interview / selected /
//     hired → taken and scored, some written answers still waiting for an evaluator).
// Applicants are never invented here: a role nobody has applied for gets its test but no assignments.
//
// Idempotent: every row has a `demo-ots-car-` id and is replaced on each run. Called from `seedOts` (db:seed-ots) and
// runnable on its own: `npm run db:seed-ots-careers`.
