// CMS panel demo data: CMS-role logins, the theme(s) (seeded from today's globals.css values,
// already "published" and active by default, so activating the CMS theme engine changes nothing
// visually until an admin explicitly switches themes), and a cms_pages draft/published doc per
// migrated route.
//
// IMPORTANT: any page here that's seeded with `status: "published"` must carry its FULL real
// section set (matching the page's own `sections.ts` fallback), not a trimmed stub — publishing
// replaces what the live site renders, so a short seed would visibly truncate the real page. This
// was gotten wrong once during Phase 1 verification (a 1-section stub got published and briefly
// live-truncated /services/web-app-development) and fixed by deleting the doc; the full set below
// is the actual permanent fix.
//
// Idempotent: re-running replaces the same demo accounts, theme docs and draft pages, but never
// overwrites a page/theme someone has since edited in the CMS (checked by existence, not content).
