// Help & Support demo data: realistic requests from this company's users, with staff replies, internal notes, AI triage and status
// history. The Support Center is a platform-level service, so its collections are shared and every row carries the company id.
// Idempotent: everything it creates has a `demo-sup-` id and is replaced on each run.
