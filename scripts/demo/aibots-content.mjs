  `# Demo Company — Company Profile (demo)

Demo Company Pvt Ltd is a software development company that designs, builds and scales web, mobile and AI/ML products for growing businesses — from MVPs to production-grade systems.

## At a glance
- Founded: 2019 · Headquarters: Bengaluru, India
- Team: 60+ engineers, designers, analysts and QA
- Delivery model: dedicated pods (PM + BA + 3–6 engineers + QA), fixed-scope projects, or staff augmentation
- Industries: healthcare, logistics, fintech, education, retail, real estate

## What makes us different
1. Discovery first — every engagement starts with a 1–2 week paid discovery that produces a BRD, clickable prototype and estimate.
2. Weekly demos and a shared board — clients see progress every week.
3. AI where it pays off — we add AI features (search, summarisation, forecasting, chat assistants) only when they have a measurable business case.
4. Post-launch care — 90 days of warranty support on every fixed-scope project.

## Certifications & practices
ISO 27001-aligned security practices, GDPR-aware data handling, code reviews on every change, automated CI/CD and test coverage targets agreed per project.`

        `## Executive summary — ABC Clinics

ABC Clinics wants to make booking an appointment as easy as sending a message, and to stop losing revenue to missed visits. Demo Company proposes a patient app (iOS and Android), a clinic web console and automated WhatsApp/SMS reminders, delivered in **about 16 weeks** by a dedicated pod.

**Why Demo Company:** we delivered almost exactly this for **MedBook**, a 40-clinic chain, where no-shows fell **31%** and front-desk calls fell **45%** in the first quarter.

**How we'll work:** a 2-week paid discovery sprint (USD 4,500) produces the BRD, a clickable prototype and a fixed estimate, followed by 2-week build sprints with a demo every week and 90 days of warranty support after launch.

Would you like me to draft the scope and commercials next? I'll need the number of doctors and whether online payments are in scope.`,

| Discovery sprint (2 weeks) | 4,500 |
| Patient app — iOS + Android | 36,000 |
| Clinic web console (120 doctors, schedules) | 14,000 |
| Payments integration + reminders | 7,500 |
| Contingency (15% of build) | 8,625 |
| **Total** | **70,625** |

**Payment milestones:** 30% on signing · 40% at UAT start · 30% at go-live.

|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "fast" is vague, no number | Can't be tested | "Search results load within 2 s for 95% of requests at 200 concurrent users." |
