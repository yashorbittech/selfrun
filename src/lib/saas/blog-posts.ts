Even no-code page builders often become confusing mazes of plugin updates, hosting configurations, and broken mobile layouts.",
          "SelfRun AI approaches website creation from a fundamentally different angle. Instead of treating your website as an isolated project disconnected from the rest of your business, the platform treats your website as the front door of your unified operations. The moment you register your company workspace, a fully functional, mobile-ready website is generated and live immediately.",

          "Unlike generic templates that come pre-filled with meaningless Latin placeholder text, SelfRun AI drafts clean, sensible headlines and descriptions suited to your line of work. A consulting firm gets service blocks and client engagement outlines, while a digital agency gets project highlights and inquiry forms.",
