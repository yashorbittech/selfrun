/**
 * Shared resolver for the Super Admin's per-user permission overrides. Every
 * module's capability predicates (e.g. `canManageProjects` in `pms-roles.ts`)
 * are built on this: `super_admin` always bypasses overrides entirely (so a
 * bad override can never lock out a super_admin, including on another
 * super_admin's account — see `src/lib/workspace/admin-users.ts`), otherwise an
 * explicit override wins, otherwise the module's own role-based default
 * applies unchanged. Overrides are additive and absent-by-default: an
 * `admin_users` row with no `permissionOverrides` behaves exactly as before
 * this feature existed.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT override-aware: each module's coarse "tier" gates
 * (`hasXAccess`, `hasXStaffRole`) — an override can only add or remove
 * capability for someone who already clears their module's tier gates via an
 * existing role; it can't promote a portal-tier user into the staff area.
 * See the comment on each module's `(staff)/layout.tsx`.
