 * don't each reinvent it.
 *
 * Same known limitation as `pms/tasks.ts`: repeated reordering into the same
 * gap can eventually produce keys too close together for float precision —
 * acceptable at this app's list sizes (single-digit nav items, page
 * sections), would need a rebalance pass before a list ever has hundreds of
