 * Maintenance-mode enforcement for the public marketing site, run from
 * `src/proxy.ts` on each page request. Public pages are statically generated
 * (ISR), so this can't live in `(site)/layout.tsx` — a layout can't read the
 * visitor's cookies without making every page dynamic.
 *
 * Deliberately an allow-list of the `(site)` route group's top-level
 * segments, not a deny-list of panels: a page missing from this list simply
 * stays up during maintenance (fail-open), whereas a missing panel in a
 * deny-list would lock staff out of it. `login`/`register` are left out on
 * purpose so portal users can still sign in.
