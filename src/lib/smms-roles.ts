/**
 * Social Media Marketing System (SMMS) role + permission model. Like every
 * other panel, access is gated on the shared `admin_users.roles` array — there
 * is no separate user store. SMMS access needs an explicit `smms_*` role (or
 * super_admin); it is never implied by another panel's role.
 *
 * Every predicate is Super-Admin-override-aware (`resolvePermission`), so the
 * Super Admin can dial individual capabilities per user at `/workspace/users`
 * (catalog entries are derived from this file in `permission-catalog.ts`).
 *
 * Pure file (no server-only imports) so client components can hide buttons —
 * hiding a button is never the security boundary; every action / route
 * re-checks with these same functions.
