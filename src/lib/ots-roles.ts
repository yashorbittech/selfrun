/**
 * Online Test System (OTS) role + permission model. Like every other panel,
 * staff access is gated on the shared `admin_users.roles` array — there is no
 * separate OTS user store. HRMS/TMS stay the source of truth for who a person
 * is, so an account's *effective* OTS roles are its explicit `ots_*` roles PLUS
 * the ones implied by its HRMS / TMS roles (see `impliedRoles`):
 *
 *   - HRMS `employee` / TMS `training_student`  → test taker (`ots_candidate`)
 *   - HRMS `hr`, TMS `tms_admin` / `tms_manager` → `ots_manager` (recruitment
 *     screening, employee assessments, batch exams)
 *   - TMS `mentor`                               → `ots_evaluator`
 *
 * Applicants and students ALSO take tests through the External Portal
 * (`external_users`) — that side never touches these roles; the portal role
 * itself (job_applicant / intern / trainee) is what lets them take tests.
 *
 * Every predicate is Super-Admin-override-aware (`resolvePermission`), so the
 * Super Admin can dial individual capabilities per user at `/workspace/users`
 * (catalog entries are derived from this file in `permission-catalog.ts`).
 *
 * Pure file (no server-only imports) so client components can hide buttons —
 * hiding a button is never the security boundary; every action / route
 * re-checks with these same functions.
