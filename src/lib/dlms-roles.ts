/**
 * DLMS (Digi Locker) role + permission model. Like every other panel, access
 * is gated on the shared `admin_users.roles` array — there is no separate DLMS
 * user store. A vault holds credentials, so DLMS access is NEVER implied by an
 * HRMS role: it needs an explicit `dlms_*` role (or super_admin).
 *
 * Two independent gates decide what a person can do to a record:
 *   1. the PERMISSION (what kind of action — view / edit / reveal …), and
 *   2. the SCOPE (which records — company, or specific clients). Managers and
 *      admins see every scope; a DLMS Employee only sees the client(s) and/or
 *      the company vault they were explicitly assigned (see `lib/dlms/access.ts`).
 *
 * Every predicate is Super-Admin-override-aware (`resolvePermission`), so the
 * Super Admin can dial individual capabilities per user at `/workspace/users`
 * (catalog entries are derived from this file in `permission-catalog.ts`).
 *
 * Pure file (no server-only imports) so client components can hide buttons —
 * hiding a button is never the security boundary; every action / route
 * re-checks with these same functions.
