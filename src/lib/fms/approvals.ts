/**
 * A single aggregated "Pending Approvals" inbox (§23, intentionally scoped
 * down). Composes three real, already-existing pending states — FMS
 * Transactions, FMS Refunds, and PRMS's personal-claim expenses — into one
 * list, each linking to its own real detail page for the actual
 * approve/reject action. Deliberately NOT a configurable approval-rules
 * engine (amount/department/vendor thresholds): neither PRMS nor FMS has
 * one anywhere in the codebase today, and building one is a substantial
 * standalone feature nobody has asked for by name — see the Phase 3 plan.
