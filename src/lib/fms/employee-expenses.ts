/**
 * FMS's "Employee Expenses" view (§13, Phase 3). PRMS already unifies
 * employee-submitted and vendor-billed expenses in one `prms_expenses`
 * collection with one flat approval tier — there is no separate "employee
 * expense" shape to peel apart. Every expense has a mandatory
 * `raisedByUserId`, even a staff-logged vendor cost, so that field alone
 * can't distinguish a personal claim; the real signal is `vendorId` being
 * unset (money owed back to the person who paid, not to a vendor) — see the
 * additive `personalClaimOnly` filter on PRMS's own `ExpenseFilter`
 * (`src/lib/prms/expenses.ts`). This module re-exports PRMS's own
 * `searchExpenses`/`getExpense` filtered that way — same wrapping pattern
 * as Phase 1's Vendors and Phase 2's Bills. Never duplicates PRMS's data.
