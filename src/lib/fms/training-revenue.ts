/**
 * FMS's Training Revenue read layer (§51 Phase 6). TMS already computes and
 * records the real fee payment (`payments` collection, real installments,
 * methods, references) — the same posture as HRMS payroll (`fms/payroll.ts`):
 * nothing to fill in, this module only reads TMS's real exports directly and
 * never writes to any TMS collection.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT posted into `fms_transactions`/the Phase 5 journal —
 * retroactively synthesizing journal entries for historical TMS payments
 * would risk the ledger's balanced-by-construction invariant for no real
 * benefit. Kept as a clearly separate, TMS-sourced figure wherever it's
 * surfaced (see `trainingRevenue` on `FmsDashboardStats`), never merged into
 * the ledger-sourced `totalRevenue`.
