}

export const FAQS: Faq[] = [
  { q: "What is SelfRun AI?", a: "SelfRun AI is one online system for running a business. It brings your customers and sales, staff and payroll, invoices and accounts, projects, purchasing, training, documents, website and team chat into one place. AI and automatic reminders and approvals work across it. You open it in a web browser or in your own apps, and it carries your business name and logo." },
  { q: "Do I need to use every part?", a: "No. Switch on only the products you need during setup. For example, you can begin with customers and invoices and add staff records or projects later. You can turn products on or off at any time from your workspace settings." },
  { q: "Is there a free plan?", a: "Yes. The free plan is free forever and includes every feature, with no card needed. Paid plans are for bigger teams: they allow more people and give you more storage and more AI, email and voice usage." },
  { q: "How long does setup take?", a: "A guided setup takes a few minutes. It asks for your business details, creates your departments, invites your team and lets you choose the products you want. If you already keep lists of leads, clients or employees in a spreadsheet, you can import them from a CSV file." },
  { q: "Can I use my own domain for my website?", a: "Yes. On plans that include a custom domain you can use your own web address, such as yourbusiness.com, and the secure (HTTPS) certificate is set up for you automatically. Every workspace also gets its own address from the start, so you can begin before you connect a domain." },
  { q: "How does the AI use my data?", a: "The AI only looks at your own business's records, and only at what the person asking is allowed to see. Its answers show how they were worked out, so you can check them. AI usage is counted per plan, so there are no surprises." },
  { q: "Is my business's data kept separate from other businesses?", a: "Yes. Every record belongs to one business, and the platform itself limits every request to that business. This is not left to individual screens. One business can never see another business's data." },
  { q: "Who can see what inside my business?", a: "You decide. Give each person a role, such as Manager or Accountant, and choose what that role may see and do in each tool. Important actions are recorded in a log, so you can see who did what and when." },
  { q: "Can I import my existing data?", a: "Yes. Leads, clients and employees can be imported from a CSV (spreadsheet) file. The importer checks each row and tells you exactly what needs fixing before anything is saved." },
  { q: "What happens if I cancel?", a: "You can cancel from your billing page. After the plan ends your workspace stays readable for a period, so you have time to export everything you need." },
  { q: "How is pricing calculated?", a: "Pricing is per business workspace. The plan you choose sets how many people can use it and how much storage and AI, email and voice usage you get. Prices are shown in your currency and do not include taxes." },
  { q: "Can I get a demo?", a: "Yes. Ask for a demo and we will walk you through the platform using examples from your own business. Or start free and explore on your own." },
];


/** More answers, grouped by topic on the FAQ page. */
export const FAQS_MORE: Faq[] = [
  { topic: "Data & security", q: "Can one business see another business's data?", a: "No. Every record belongs to one business and the platform adds that business to every database query itself, so a page, report or export cannot ask for another business's rows. See Security & Trust." },
  { topic: "Data & security", q: "Can the AI change my data on its own?", a: "No. Business questions use read-only queries with the asker's permissions. When an assistant proposes to create, edit or delete something, nothing happens until the person approves it, deletes ask for a second confirmation, and every action is logged." },
  { topic: "Data & security", q: "Can I export my data or leave?", a: "Yes. Tables can be exported to CSV or Excel and documents downloaded as PDF. If you cancel, the workspace stays readable so you can export, and you can ask for permanent deletion of your business's data." },
  { topic: "Data & security", q: "Who can see salaries, payroll and financial statements?", a: "Only people with the specific permission for them. Payroll, salary, bank and statement views are limited by role, even for managers, and every export and change is recorded in the audit log." },
  { topic: "Support", q: "How do I get support?", a: "Inside the product the Help & Support product has a help center, an AI help assistant and support requests you can follow from open to resolved, with attachments and notifications. You can also write to us through the contact page." },
  { topic: "Plans & pricing", q: "What does the Free plan include?", a: "Every feature, free forever. Paid plans add more people and bigger storage, AI, email and voice allowances." },
  { topic: "Plans & pricing", q: "Are any features locked behind a higher plan?", a: "No. Every plan includes every feature. Plans differ only by team size and by allowances." },
  { topic: "Plans & pricing", q: "Can I change plans later?", a: "Yes. You can upgrade as your team grows or move down when you need less. Your data stays in place." },
  { topic: "Plans & pricing", q: "Are prices shown with tax?", a: "No. Prices exclude applicable taxes, and invoices show the tax separately." },
  { topic: "Your brand", q: "Will my team and clients see SelfRun's brand?", a: "No. Your logo, name, colours, domain, emails and apps carry your business's identity. SelfRun stays in the background." },
  { topic: "Your brand", q: "Can I have my own mobile and desktop apps?", a: "Yes. The platform generates your installable app, Android and iOS apps and Windows, macOS and Linux desktop apps from your branding. For the stores you sign the Android and iOS projects with your own developer accounts." },
  { topic: "Your brand", q: "Can I use more than one website theme?", a: "Yes. The theme library lets you preview, activate and customise themes — colours, fonts and components — and switch whenever you like." },
  { topic: "Your brand", q: "Do push notifications come from my business?", a: "Yes. Push notifications reach your team and your website visitors in your name, on the devices where they have allowed them." },
  { topic: "AI & automation", q: "What can I ask the AI?", a: "Anything about your business data in plain language — for example overdue invoices, leads by source, who is on leave or which projects are late. It answers with text, a table or a chart and shows how it calculated the answer." },
  { topic: "AI & automation", q: "Can the AI change my data?", a: "No. Questions are answered with read-only queries, and the AI only uses data the person asking is allowed to see." },
  { topic: "AI & automation", q: "Do I need to write code to automate things?", a: "No. Workflows are built from a trigger, optional conditions and actions on a settings screen, starting from ready-made templates." },
  { topic: "AI & automation", q: "Can I build an AI assistant on my own documents?", a: "Yes. Create a bot with your instructions and knowledge files, choose who can use it, and track its usage and cost." },
  { topic: "AI & automation", q: "Can AI answer my website visitors?", a: "Yes. The website chatbot answers from a knowledge base you control, and Conversation AI adds voice. Every conversation is logged for review." },
  { topic: "Apps & devices", q: "Which devices are supported?", a: "The web app works in any modern browser. You can install it on Android, iPhone and iPad, Windows, macOS, Linux and ChromeOS, and generate Android, iOS and desktop apps." },
  { topic: "Apps & devices", q: "Do the apps need updating when you add features?", a: "No. The apps load your workspace, so new features and branding changes appear without reinstalling." },
  { topic: "Data & security", q: "Can I export my data?", a: "Yes. You can export records and reports at any time, and after a plan ends your workspace stays readable for a period so you can take what you need." },
  { topic: "Data & security", q: "How do I see who did what?", a: "Each product keeps its own activity records and sign-in history. Open that product's audit tools to review and export the activity available there." },
  { topic: "Data & security", q: "How are passwords and credentials protected?", a: "Credentials, API keys and vault documents are encrypted at rest, and business data is isolated from every other business at the data layer." },
  { topic: "Setup", q: "How do I get my existing data in?", a: "Import leads, clients and employees from CSV. Every row is validated and the importer tells you exactly what to fix. Imports never trigger workflows." },
  { topic: "Setup", q: "Can I use my own domain?", a: "Yes. Add your domain, publish the DNS records shown, and the platform verifies it and issues the SSL certificate automatically." },
  { topic: "Setup", q: "Do I have to use every product?", a: "No. Choose the products you need. Each product runs independently with its own sign-in and database; add other products whenever you are ready." },
  { topic: "Support", q: "Where do I get help?", a: "Signed-in users have an AI help assistant that knows the screen they are on, a searchable help center and a request desk with status tracking. You can also contact the team from this website." },
