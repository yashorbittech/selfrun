    {
      q: "What is SelfRun AI?",
      a: "SelfRun AI is a suite of independent business products for sales, people, finance, projects, purchasing, training, documents, websites, collaboration and support. CommandOS provides a shared company control center, and configured workflows connect specific records and actions across products.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do I have to use every product?",
      a: "No. Products are designed to work independently, so a company can start with the products it needs and add others later. Access to products and their screens still depends on the company’s configuration and each user’s permissions.",
    },
    {
      q: "How is access to business data controlled?",
      a: "CommandOS provides roles and fine-grained permissions for product areas and actions. Product access is checked against the signed-in user, and activity is recorded in audit tools; the exact screens available depend on the permissions assigned to that user.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can one company access another company’s records?",
      a: "No. Company data is scoped to its owning company in the data layer, so a company’s users cannot query another company’s records through the product.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can workflows connect actions in different products?",
      a: "Workflows use triggers, optional conditions and actions. Implemented examples include creating a SprintOS client record when a DealFlow AI deal is won and posting payroll results from TalentOS to CashFlow AI; available actions depend on the configured workflow.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can AI read or change company records?",
      a: "DataBrain AI answers questions from the current user’s permitted business data with read-only queries. Other AI features have their own product-specific behavior and permissions, so the DataBrain read-only rule should not be assumed to describe every assistant or generator.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I bring existing data into SelfRun?",
      a: "The platform includes CSV imports for supported record types such as leads, clients and employees. Importers validate supported fields and report rows that need correction; available import types vary by product.",
    },
    {
      q: "Where can users get product help?",
      a: "ResolveIQ includes a searchable help center, an assistant that searches published help content, and support requests with status tracking. Users can also contact the SelfRun team through the website contact page.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I use my own domain for my website?",
      a: "Yes. The domain setup flow asks you to add the DNS records shown for your domain, then verify the configuration; the platform provisions SSL automatically after verification.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can AgentOS assistants be configured for different jobs?",
      a: "Yes. Each AgentOS bot can have its own instructions, model, knowledge files and access rules.",
      evidence: ["src/lib/products/agentos/bots.ts:15-18", "src/components/products/agentos/BotForm.tsx:174-203"],
    },
    {
      q: "What information is needed to create an AgentOS bot?",
      a: "A bot requires a name and system instructions, and its form lets an administrator choose an allowed model and configure other options such as prompts, attachments and access.",
      evidence: ["src/components/products/agentos/BotForm.tsx:120-132", "src/components/products/agentos/BotForm.tsx:174-229", "src/lib/products/agentos/bots.ts:194-207"],
    },
    {
      q: "Can DataBrain AI update the records it analyzes?",
      a: "No. DataBrain AI uses read-only queries and has no write path to change those business records.",

    },
    {
      q: "Does DataBrain AI show the same data to every employee?",
      a: "No. Its available data is filtered by company entitlements, enabled products and the signed-in user's data permissions.",
      evidence: ["src/lib/products/databrain-ai/catalog/view.ts:9-16", "src/lib/products/databrain-ai/catalog/view.ts:58-74"],

    },
    {
      q: "Where can users search for product help?",

    },
    {
      q: "How does CashFlow AI link an invoice to a customer?",
      a: "An invoice selects an existing SprintOS client as its customer rather than creating a separate finance customer record, and keeps a customer-name snapshot on the invoice.",
      evidence: ["src/lib/products/cashflow-ai/invoices.ts:30-45", "src/app/(products)/cashflow-ai/(protected)/invoices/actions.ts:57-81"],

      q: "What happens after a SpendIQ requisition is submitted?",

    },
    {

      evidence: ["docs/products.md:81-88"],
    },
    {
      q: "Can a SprintOS project have a project manager?",
      a: "Yes. Project records store a project-manager ID, and the project form loads employee options for manager selection.",
