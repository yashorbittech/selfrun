        q: "Which customer records does CashFlow use for invoicing?",
        a: "Invoices select an existing SprintOS client as the customer rather than creating a separate finance customer record; the invoice keeps a customer-name snapshot for the invoice.",

        q: "Can I assign an invoice to a project?",
        a: "Yes. An invoice can retain a project reference alongside its client, so finance records can be associated with a SprintOS project.",

        q: "Can I use an invoice discount?",

      {
        q: "Can invoice dates and due dates be different?",

      },

        q: "Can I void a receipt that was entered incorrectly?",

      },
      {
        q: "Can I issue a credit note against an invoice?",

      {
        q: "Can clients see their CashFlow invoices in ClientOS?",
        a: "Yes. The client invoice view uses the signed-in client’s invoice records and presents a portal-safe invoice summary.",

      },
      {
        q: "Are draft or void invoices shown in the client portal?",

        q: "Does CashFlow show receivables by age?",
        a: "The receivables and payables logic uses aging buckets to summarize overdue balances, rather than only a single overall balance.",

        q: "Can I track bills and vendor balances as well as customer invoices?",

      },
      {
        q: "Can a customer refund be linked to an earlier receipt?",
        a: "Yes. Refund records reference a receipt and the refund logic checks the original receipt before accepting the refund.",

        q: "Can a refund be larger than the amount received?",

      },
      {
        q: "Can employees request an advance and later record repayment?",
        a: "Yes. Advance actions cover requesting an advance, changing its status and recording repayments; repayments reduce the outstanding amount.",

        q: "Does CashFlow track employee expenses for reimbursement?",
        a: "Yes. Employee expense detail and reimbursement flows track reimbursed totals and can post reimbursements with project references.",

      },
      {
        q: "Can I reconcile bank statement lines to transactions?",
        a: "Yes. Bank reconciliation lets users match a statement line to a transaction, and it rejects a match if the transaction belongs to a different bank account.",

      },
