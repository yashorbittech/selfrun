 * Platform-wide maintenance (Platform Panel → Maintenance). Pure helpers, no server imports: used by the proxy, the root layout, the

 *
 * One window for every company: from `startsAt` to `endsAt`. Before it starts there is an announcement banner with a countdown to the
 * start; during it, either a banner ("banner") or the full maintenance screen instead of the site / panels ("takeover"), with a
 * countdown to the end; after `endsAt` everything is back on its own, with nobody having to switch anything off.
