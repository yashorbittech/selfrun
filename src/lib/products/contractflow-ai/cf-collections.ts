/**
 * Names of the ContractFlow signing-and-vault collections (prefix `cf_`). Client-safe: names only, no database access.
 *
 * Tenancy: every collection is company-scoped by default (`lib/platform/tenancy/scoped-db.ts`). A collection whose `_id` is a fixed key
 * (a counter or a settings singleton) MUST also be listed in `KEYED_COLLECTIONS` (`lib/platform/tenancy/collections.ts`), or two companies
 * would collide on the same `_id`. `CF_ID_KIND` declares which kind each collection is; `scripts/test-cf-foundation.ts` fails when a
 * fixed-`_id` collection is not registered, or when source code names a `cf_` collection that is not declared here.
 *
 * The old `lpms_*` collections are NOT touched by this file: they are kept as they are (see `archive-plan.ts`).
