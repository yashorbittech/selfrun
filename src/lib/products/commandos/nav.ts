/**
 * The Workspace navigation — the one definition of what a company's Workspace
 * contains and who may open each part. Pure data + pure rules (safe to import
 * anywhere); the server side that loads a user's context and guards pages is
 * `access.ts`.
 *
 * An item is available when ALL of these hold:
 *   1. `allow(user)` — a rule built from the existing role files
 *      (`*-roles.ts`) and the permission catalog (`permissionOverrides`,
 *      resolved by `resolvePermission`). Director has access across all products.
 *   2. The product is switched on for this company and in the product registry.
 *   3. `platform` items: the Platform Console's own access check passed.
