/**
 * SOP Panel role + permission model. Like every other panel, access is gated
 * on the shared `admin_users.roles` array — there is no separate SOP user
 * store. HRMS stays the source of truth for who an employee is, so an
 * account's *effective* SOP roles are its explicit `sop_*` roles PLUS the
 * ones implied by its HRMS role (see `impliedFromHrms`): every HRMS
 * `employee` can read/acknowledge SOPs without a second role grant.
 *
 * Permissions are the twelve granular capabilities from the SOP spec. There
 * is deliberately NO review / approve / reject permission: publishing is a
 * direct action for anyone holding `PUBLISH`.
 *
 * Every predicate is Super-Admin-override-aware (`resolvePermission`), so the
 * Super Admin can dial individual capabilities per user at `/workspace/users`
 * (catalog entries live in `src/lib/workspace/permission-catalog.ts`).
 *
 * This file is pure (no server-only imports) so client components can use it
 * to hide buttons — but hiding a button is never the security boundary; every
 * server action / route re-checks with these same functions.
