/**
 * Renders a page's sections through the type registry. Unknown types and
 * configs that fail to parse are skipped, never thrown — a bad CMS write
 * must never break the live site (same fail-soft principle as the SEO
 * panel's metadata overrides).
 *
 * `config.parse`/`toProps` always come from the base `SECTION_REGISTRY`
 * entry (content shape is theme-agnostic); which component renders the
 * resolved props can differ per theme: the active theme's variant choices
 * come from `ThemeVariantsProvider` (set once in `(site)/layout.tsx`, or by
 * the theme preview) and are resolved by `resolveSectionRenderer`.
 *
 * Client component: `toProps()` resolves icon keys into real icon component
 * references, and a component reference can't cross the server/client
 * boundary as a prop — only the (JSON-safe) `sections` data does that, from
 * the server page down into this component.
